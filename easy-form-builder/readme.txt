Create flexible contact forms, survey forms, payment forms, and user authentication forms using a drag-and-drop form builder plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

 Easy Form Builder is a comprehensive WordPress form plugin designed to help website owners create, manage, and maintain a wide variety of forms using a visual drag-and-drop form builder interface. The plugin is suitable for users who want to build professional forms without writing code, while still keeping full control over form data, submissions, and communication workflows.

This form builder plugin can be used to create contact forms, support request forms, survey and feedback forms, payment forms using Stripe, subscription forms and custom login or registration forms for WordPress users. All form data is stored directly on your WordPress website, ensuring transparency, data ownership, and predictable behavior.

 Easy Form Builder focuses on clarity, extensibility, and usability. The plugin does not rely on external form services by default and does not send form submissions to third-party servers. This makes it suitable for websites that require clear data handling policies and on-site form management.


== What Can This Form Plugin Do? ==

With  Easy Form Builder, you can use a single form plugin to build and manage multiple types of forms and form-based workflows:

- Contact forms for general inquiries
- Support and feedback forms with message tracking
- Survey and poll forms with structured results
- Stripe payment forms for online payments
- Login (sign-in) forms for WordPress users
- Registration (sign-up) forms for new users
- File upload forms
- Private or restricted-access forms
- Multi-step forms for improved usability

The form builder provides a consistent interface for form creation, submission handling, and response management inside WordPress.


== Core Features ==

= Drag & Drop Form Builder =
The plugin includes a visual drag-and-drop form builder. Fields can be added, removed, and reordered without writing code. Each field provides configuration options such as labels, placeholders, validation rules, and display settings.

= Email Notification =
Easy Form Builder supports automatic email notifications after a form is submitted. Notifications can be sent to administrators, form managers, or users. Email templates can be customized to control the message content and layout.

For detailed setup instructions, see:
[How to set up form notification emails in Easy Form Builder](https://whitestudio.team/document/how-to-set-up-form-notification-emails-in-easy-form-builder/)

= Confirmation Code (Tracking ID) =
Each form submission generates a unique confirmation code. This tracking ID allows administrators and users to reference, search, and manage individual submissions efficiently.

Learn more about this feature:
[How to activate a Confirmation Code in Easy Form Builder](https://whitestudio.team/document/how-to-activate-confirmation-code-in-easy-form-builder/)

= Form Validation and Spam Protection =
The form plugin includes client-side and server-side validation. Google reCAPTCHA v2 can be enabled to reduce spam and automated submissions.

= Multi-Step Forms =
Multi-step forms allow long forms to be divided into multiple sections. This improves user experience and helps reduce form abandonment.


== Form Entry & Message Management Dashboard ==

 Easy Form Builder includes a dedicated **Form Entry & Message Management Dashboard** that allows administrators to manage all form submissions directly from the WordPress admin area. This dashboard acts as a centralized system for reviewing messages, tracking requests, and communicating with users without relying solely on email.

Through this dashboard, administrators can read submitted messages, respond directly from the WordPress backend, and attach files to replies when needed. This approach helps keep communication organized and ensures that conversations related to form submissions remain accessible in one place.

The Form Entry & Message Management Dashboard also provides practical tools for organizing and reviewing submissions. Administrators can change the status of messages (Open or Closed), edit or delete entries, search submissions by form or confirmation code, and receive notifications when new messages arrive. Form responses and message data can be downloaded in PDF format or exported to CSV files for reporting, archiving, or further analysis.


== Survey and Poll Forms ==

Easy Form Builder includes dedicated fields for creating survey and poll forms. These fields allow website owners to collect structured feedback and analyze results directly inside WordPress.

Survey-related features include:

- Rating star fields
- 5-point scale fields
- Net Promoter Score (NPS) fields
- Yes / No question fields
- Visual charts for survey results
- Exporting survey responses to CSV format

Survey forms can be used for customer feedback, research, evaluations, and internal assessments.


== Payment Forms with Stripe ==

 Easy Form Builder supports Stripe payment fields, allowing you to collect online payments securely through your WordPress forms.

You can use Stripe payment fields to create:

- Donation forms
- Order forms
- Booking and service payment forms

Payment entries are handled alongside other form submissions and can be reviewed through the form management dashboard.

For a step-by-step guide, see:
[How to Create a payment form to collect online payments in Easy Form Builder](https://whitestudio.team/document/how-to-create-a-payment-form-in-easy-form-builder/)


== Login and Registration Forms ==

The form builder allows you to create custom login and registration forms for WordPress users. These forms can replace the default WordPress login page and provide a customized user onboarding experience.

Login and registration forms integrate with WordPress user management and allow you to control form layout, validation, and additional user fields.

== Advanced Form Fields ==

 Easy Form Builder provides a wide collection of advanced form fields, including:

- Drag and drop file upload fields
- Signature (e-signature) fields
- Location picker fields (OpenStreetMap and LeafletJS)
- Country, state/province, and city dropdown fields
- Multiple select dropdown fields
- Range slider fields
- Rating and star fields
- Switch and toggle fields
- Date pickers (Gregorian, Hijri, and Jalali)
- Telephone and mobile input fields

These fields allow you to build complex, region-aware, and structured forms without custom development.


== Integrations and Add-ons ==

 Easy Form Builder supports optional integrations and add-ons that extend the functionality of the form plugin:

- SMS notification add-on for sending text messages on form submission

- Stripe add-on for extended payment workflows

- Offline forms add-on for collecting data without an active internet connection
